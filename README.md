# Image-Classification-for-a-City-Dog-Show

## Project Goal

In this project an image classifier will be used to identify dog breeds.

## Tasks

* Determine which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs".
* Determine how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed.
* Time how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem.
